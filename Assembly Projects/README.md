# MY ASSEMBLY PROJECTS

# Description 
i was learning how to code in assembly to see what the hype was all about. look to be honnest this aint for everyone. I tried and gave up. the create adventure project (`create_advendure.asm`), is a terminal story project. I think its a story inspired by that one MR robot episode, you know the [Choose your adventure game]. Didnt go far, but i tried something tho.


The HELLO WORLD project (`hello_world.asm`) was just me testing how to print heloo world in assembly, cause wt* was this. its my first program dont blame me. 


The Venda Poem Project (`venda-poem.asm`) is just a program reciting a Venda poem, i had in my head. yes the current developer is Venda.
